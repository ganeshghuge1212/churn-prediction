## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values in `TotalCharges`
   - Converted data types and dropped irrelevant columns like `customerID`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized churn distribution
   - Correlation heatmap, countplots, boxplots for insights

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label Encoding for categorical features
   - Feature scaling if required

4. **Model Building**
   - Used `RandomForestClassifier`
   - Train-test split with 80/20 ratio
   - Evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score

5. **Model Accuracy**
   - Achieved ~80% accuracy
